CaveCAD - 2D CAD for Cave Mapping
=================================

CaveCAD is a 2D CAD application for drawing cave surveys and maps, built as a
modified version of [QCAD Community Edition](https://qcad.org) by RibbonSoft
GmbH. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by RibbonSoft.

CaveCAD keeps QCAD's full 2D drafting core and adds cave-specific branding,
its own settings/data location (so it coexists with a regular QCAD install),
and is designed to host the Cave Survey tool suite (traverse plotting, survey
file import from Walls/Compass/Survex, LRUD passage walls, map fitting,
breakdown symbols, and georeferencing).
