Summary of modifications (August 2026 onward)
---------------------------------------------
- Rebranded the application as "CaveCAD": application name, macOS bundle
  name/display name, and settings file (CaveCAD3.ini), giving it a per-user
  data and scripts location separate from any QCAD install on the same
  machine (src/run/main.cpp, src/run/Info.plist).
- New CaveCAD logo, application icon, and splash screen, with a QCAD
  attribution line on the splash screen.
- Repackaged script resource lists to match the CaveCAD script set
  (src/scripts/scripts.qrc, src/scripts/scripts_release.qrc).
- Documentation updated for CaveCAD (README.md, readme.txt, this file).
- Completed the rename of QCAD-named build artifacts and files: application
  bundle and executable (CaveCAD.app/CaveCAD), bundle identifier
  (org.cavecad.CaveCAD), shared libraries and plugins (libqcad* to
  libcavecad*), translation files (ts/qcad* to ts/cavecad*), icons,
  Windows version resources, desktop entry, man page, and Doxygen project.
  Internal QCAD API names (R-prefixed classes, R_QCAD_VERSION_* macros,
  QCAD_DLL) and GPL attribution headers are unchanged.

What is NOT included
--------------------
CaveCAD contains no QCAD Professional or QCAD/CAM components. In particular,
the proprietary DWG plugin is not included; file exchange is DXF (via dxflib,
GPL) only.

GNU General Public License version 3 (see gpl-3.0.txt), consistent with the
